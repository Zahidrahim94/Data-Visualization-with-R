 #Data Visualization with Graph Theory Elements

This repository contains R code for generating data visualizations using the ggplot2 library and incorporating graph theory elements. The code visualizes the famous Iris dataset and demonstrates various plot types, including scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, histograms, box plots, and grid plots.

## Prerequisites

To run the code, you need the following libraries installed:

- ggplot2
- ggthemes

You can install these libraries using the following commands in R:

```R
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("ggthemes")
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the R script file.

2. Make sure the required libraries are installed.

3. Run the R script in your R environment or IDE.

The script generates multiple visualizations of the Iris dataset, incorporating graph theory elements such as annotations, colors, and labels.

## Generated Plots

The script generates the following plots:

1. Scatter Plot of Iris Sepal Width vs. Length
2. Line Plot of Iris Petal Length by Species
3. Bar Plot of Iris Species Counts
4. Histogram of Iris Sepal Width
5. Box Plot of Iris Petal Width by Species
6. Grid of Scatter Plots for Iris Species
7. Scatter Plot with Smooth Trend Lines for Iris Species

All plots are saved in high-quality JPEG format in a separate folder named "images" within the project directory.

## Customization

You can customize the plots by modifying the code. For example, you can change the color palette, labels, titles, or add additional graph theory elements as per your requirements.

## Folder Structure

- `images`: This folder contains the generated plots in high-quality JPEG format. The folder is created with the current date and time as the folder name.
